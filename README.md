# Hack13's Personal Site

**Repository:** https://git.hack13.dev/hack13/hack13-site (Primary, GitHub is a mirror)

This is my personal site that I have built with Astro. Everything is statically generated then pushed to [storj](https://storj.io) for hosting. You can view the site at https://www.hack13.me/ or by just clicking [here](https://www.hack13.me/).

## Building

1. Clone the repo
2. Run 'yarn install'
3. Run 'yarn build'
4. Upload contents of 'dist' to your host
